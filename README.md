# Assignment 12.1: Create a Maze

Utilizing what you have learned, put together your own maze using the XR toolkit and Snaps prototype package. Make sure your maze has some sort of interactable “key” that is used to open a door or otherwise progress through the level. This will enhance your VR environment to allow a user to interact directly with the space and with specific items in an immersive context. Feel free to get creative with any other models or assets you are interested in!

Use this assignment to familiarize yourself with the XR Rig and its various components—in particular, the locomotion system and its associated providers as well as the XR Direct/Ray Interactors. This is the crucial foundation that can turn any 3D environment into an explorable and interactive VR app.

It is also important that you use GitHub as a place to store your source files and as practice in version control since you will soon be sharing this particular project with your peers.

Requirements checklist:

- The maze includes at least four turns.
- The maze includes at least two dead ends.
- The environment objects are aligned to the grid.
- The player must use a grabbable object to progress further.
- A win state is activated upon entering the final section.
- The maze must be playable with the VR headset.
- The project must be on GitHub and marked public.

Edit your GitHub ReadMe to include notes about your experience building the maze, such as the challenges you overcame, links to other assets you may have added on your own, and specifically the resources you found to be most helpful. This will be important for your next assignment, where another learner will be reading your notes and entering your maze.
